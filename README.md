This repository contains a complete implementation of a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The ALU supports fundamental operations including addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, and AND NOT. This project is intended for students, hobbyists, and professionals seeking to understand digital design concepts and hardware description language (HDL) coding practices. The design, testbench, and simulation scripts provided in this repository enable users to explore, simulate, and modify the ALU as a learning tool or as a basis for more complex digital systems.
